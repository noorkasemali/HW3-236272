HW3 dry:

Question 1 :
the class used is SnappingSheetController.Using SnappingSheetController, developers can control the Snapping Sheet
(by calling for example setSnappingSheetPosition(),stopCurrentSnapping(),SnapToPosition(),etc.) 
it also can be used to extract information from the sheet (by accessing fields like currentPosition,isAttached,etc.) 

Question 2 :
The snappingPositions parameter

Question 3 :
advantage of GestureDetector : detect every type of interaction the user has with the screen.
